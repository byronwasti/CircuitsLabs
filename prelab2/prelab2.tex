\section{Question 1}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:diode}
    I = I_s(e^{V/U_T} - 1)
\end{equation}


\begin{itemize}

    \item [(a)] 
        If we force greater than a nanoamp into the diode-connected transistor, eliminating the second term of the ideal diode equation (shown in equation \ref{eq:diode}) is a good approximation. If we take $I_s$ to be a few femptoamps, then we can rearange equation \ref{eq:diode} to be $\frac{I}{I_s} = e^{V/U_T} - 1$. If we take $I$ to be greater than a nanoamp, then the left side of the equation is large. This means that the $-1$ does not affect the equation to a massive degree, and thus can be disgarded for approximation's sake.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:approxDiode}
    I = I_s(e^{V/U_T})
\end{equation}

    \item [(b)] 
        If we increase the current by one e-fold, then the voltage would increase by $U_T$. This is because $Ie^1 = I_s(e^{V/U_T})e^1$, which simplifies to $Ie^1 = I_s( e^{ \frac{V + U_T}{U_T}})$. If we increase the current by one decade, we get $10I = 10I_se^{V/U_T}$. Using the laws of logarithms, we can simplify this equation to $10I = I_se^{\frac{V+U_T\ln{(10)}}{U_T}}$. Thus the voltage is increased by $U_T\ln{(10)}$ when the current is increased by a decade.

    \item [(c)]
        We can start with equation \ref{eq:approxDiode} and solve for $V$. We now have $V = U_T\ln{(\frac{I}{I_s})}$. Using the taylor expansion of $\ln$, and only taking the first order term, we can simplify to $\delta V = \frac{U_T}{I_s}\ln{(\frac{I}{I_s})}\delta I$. Thus, we can find $\frac{ \delta V}{\delta I} = \frac{U_T}{I} = r_d$. 

    \item [(d)]
        I would not expect the situation to differ because the I-V characteristic is defined, and although non-linear, the tangent line approximation will stay the same regardless of whether $V$ or $I$ changes.
        
    \item [(e)]
        We would take voltage measurements for small changes in current (above and below a set point), for which we could apply linear regression to approximate a tangent line and use this line to find $U_T$. By then sweeping the current and measuring voltage, we can find the exponential curve the diode follows, and since we know all the values except for $I_s$, we can extract $I_s$. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Question 2}

\begin{itemize}
    \item [(a)]
        If we plug in the input current $I$ into the approximated ideal diode equation which is shown in equation \ref{eq:approxDiode}, we can then solve for $V$ and get $V = U_T\ln{(\frac{I}{I_s})}$. The voltage across the resistor is simply given by $V_R = IR$, and the total voltage is the sum of all voltages (by KVL) and is thus $V_{in} = V_R + V = IR +U_T\ln{(\frac{I}{I_s})}$.

    \item [(b)]
        We showed in class that $\delta V_R = \delta IR$. For $\delta V$, we know that $\delta V = \delta I R_d$ and from Q1c, we have $\delta V = \delta I \frac{U_T}{I}$. Thus, using KVL again, we have $\delta V_{in} = \delta I (R + \frac{U_T}{I})$.

    \item [(c)]
        We can start with $V_R = V$, since we are trying to find the point where the supplied input current causes an equal increase in the voltages across the resistor and diode connected transistor. Thus, $\delta I R = \delta I \frac{U_T}{I}$. We can solve for $I$, which is $I_{on}$, which gives us $I_{on} = \frac{U_T}{R}$.

    \item [(d)]
        We can simply plug in $I_{on}$ into the voltage equation found in part (a), and we get $V_{on} = U_T\ln{(\frac{I_{on}}{I_s})}$.

    \item [(e)]
        To find $\delta V_R$, we can use the known voltage divider ratio. This means $\delta V_R = \delta V_{in} \frac{R}{R + \frac{U_T}{I}}$. We can multiply the fraction by $\frac{ \frac{1}{U_T} }{ \frac{1}{U_T} }$ and thus get $\delta V_R = \delta V_{in} \frac{I}{I + I_{on}}$. \\

        To find $\delta V$, we can use the same technique except with $\delta V = \delta V_{in} \frac{ \frac{U_T}{I} }{R + \frac{U_T}{I} }$. Thus, simplifying, we get $\delta V = \delta V_{in} \frac{I_{on}}{I + I_{on}}$.

    \item [(f)]
        If $I \ll I_{on}$, then $I_{on}$ dominates the fraction in the equation for $\delta V = \delta V_{in} \frac{I_{on}}{I + I_{on}}$. Thus, we get $\delta V = \delta V_{in}$. This means that $V$ is independent of $I$, and will not change with $I$. \\

        If $I \gg I_{on}$, then $I$ dominates the fraction of $\delta V_{in}$ that appears across the diode-connected transistor, and thus none of the $\delta V_{in}$ is contributed by $\delta V$. With these circumstances, $V$ is not changing relative to $V_{in}$ and thus $V_{in}$ will change with $I$ via Ohm's law with the resistor, ie. $V_{in} = IR$.

    \item [(g)]
        If we suppose that we were to apply the input voltage and measure the current, then $V$ would change with $V_{in}$ when $V_{in} < V_{on}$ and would remain $V = V_{in}$. $I$ would not depend on $V_{in}$ under these circumstances, because there would be no current flowing regardless of the change in $V_{in}$.

        When $V_{in} > V_{on}$, then $V$ would not change with a change in $V_{in}$, but $I$ would now depend on $V_{in}$ in this situation via Ohm's law with the resistor, and by $I = \frac{V_{in}}{R}$.

\end{itemize}
